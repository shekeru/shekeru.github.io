title:  "Getting Haunted"
---
The world haunts me. People haunt me. My own shortcomings haunt me. Is this anxiety? Is this angst? Feeling unsettled outside of my room. Feeling unsettled lying down, doing nothing, being nothing. With enough sleep deprivation these thoughts become voices. But normally, they're just that. My own thoughts. Internal desires yet to be externalized. Reasons to change. Highly reactive, abrasive reasons to change. Are they reacting to distractions? Anything unpredictable I might regret?
