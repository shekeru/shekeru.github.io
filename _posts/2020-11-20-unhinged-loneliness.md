title:  "Unhinged Loneliness"
---
Anti-real circuits feed us our delusions. Paranoia is an actuation of the "what ifs" of probability rather than a deterministic present. Time is explored linearly through our set of perceptions, but more successful life interprets a stochastic future, attempting to ensure survival in the majority of outcomes. I feel alone and unhinged in this present.
