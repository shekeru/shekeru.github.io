Psychosis. Is never ending. Sometimes better, sometimes worse. It makes everything feel intrinsically wrong. It breeds confusion. Anxiety. When it's worse, it warps reality through your senses. When it's better, it still haunts you, ever present. Your thoughts are racing, scrambled. You can attach to something, and it becomes your raison d'etre. Then it ends. Then you lose everything. Mentally. You had already lost yourself in it. Having become consumed by it. You neglected your own thoughts and detachment. Now your thoughts are gone.
