title:  "A Second Stuck in Time"
---
The past month, a lack of writing. The past month, over-motivation. Many started new projects with little to no goals. The accomplishment didn’t matter, only the action did. Everything was never enough. The performance was never ending. In a circular manner, it gave me a reason to sleep. It gave me a reason, to think, simply, clearly. If there was to be anxiety, it would be physical. Sweaty, restless, physicality. A curse and a blessing away from the creator’s dread. Living life in the triumph of the moment. Was this broken metronome something I desired? Was it something I detested? Stuck on go, my mind unable to say no.
