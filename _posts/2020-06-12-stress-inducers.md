title:  "Stress Inducers"
---
Stress. By its nature, it drives you to eliminate it. Usually when we can't, it is terminal. Haunting us until we die. Inducing temporary stress, is uniquely a higher order disorder. Jobs, military, prisons, psych wards. Stress inducers we are coerced into. When you can't escape it, then the neuroticism sets in.

Once it starts, you're treated differently.

It becomes a spiral worsened by other dysfunctional humans.

Will I get better once it ends?

The underlying problems are still there. My head hurts. Everything is spinning. Everything is in motion. It's always falling apart.
