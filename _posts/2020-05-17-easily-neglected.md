title:  "Doing Nothing, Being Nothing"
---
Sometimes, I'm bored. Times when I can do anything. Other times, I waste my free time doing nothing, somehow feeling content. If I'm bored by all my normal activities, are there subconscious desires gnawing at me? Desires I long ago thought hopeless, and discarded?

It seems, I have many such desires. Childhood wants, teenage motivations, abandoned adulthood goals. Is the only logical path to give in and fulfill them? In reality, that is abysmally hard, abysmally hopeless. They are not easily remembered, and I am easily distracted. Easily neglectful. Problems long ignored, are most likely problems still ignored.
