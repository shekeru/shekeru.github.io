Every night, I beat the nigger.  
Every night, the nigger screams.  
When the cops find me  
When the cops find me,  
I know I'm right.  
The nigger, the nigger, the nigger.  
The nigger, the nigger, the nigger, the nigger.  
The nigger, the nigger, the nigger, the nigger.  
I know I'm right.  
I know I'm right.  

Every night, I beat the nigger.  
Every night, the nigger screams.  
The nigger screams. It screams.  
The nigger cries. It cries.  
The nigger's tears. It cries.  
You see, the nigger has no voice,  
The nigger is nothing.  
But the nigger says "I cry for a living."  
You see, the nigger says "I can never tell  
Where I came from."  
You see, the nigger says "I can never tell  
Where I am going."  
You see, the nigger says "I can never tell  
Where I have been."  
The nigger says "I can never tell  
Where I have been. "  
And then the nigger comes back.  
It's not so much the words that make the difference  
It's how it's said.  

But I think it's something that's more important  
When you're talking to a nigger, you need to be careful.  
If you say "I love you," you can go ahead and kiss 'im,  
If you say "I hate you," you can go ahead and kick 'im  
That's not how to talk to a nigger  
So I always think to myself when I'm with a nigger,  
"I love him/her. I hate them."  
And if they don't get the point,  
Then they'll know I know how to deal with 'em.  
I don't hate them; I want to live with 'em.  
And if we don't love each other,  
We have nothing to lose.  

"No, no! The nigger is the man's only friend."  
Well, I want to keep you for a long, long time.  
I think about you a lot.  
It makes me so mad, I'm sick and tired of it.  
I don't want to die alone.  
We have to be able to live together if we're going to live.  
I want to be around for you to help make it all happen.  
"We don't have time for love, we don't have time for hate.
We can't live with the pain and the strife. We have to love each other.‚Äù
